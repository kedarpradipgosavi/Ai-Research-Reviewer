Abstract -Cryptography and network security are foundational domains in the field of information technology and cybersecurity. As digital communication continues to expand, protecting data from unauthorized access, tampering, and interception is paramount. This paper presents a detailed review of the core principles, algorithms, protocols, emerging technologies, and challenges in cryptography and network security. We explore classical and modern cryptographic techniques, the structure and defense mechanisms of network security, current advancements such as quantum cryptography and blockchain integration, and propose future research directions.z
